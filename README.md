# Python Intermediate Projects

These are the Python projects I made after finishing my beginner level.  
They are a bit bigger and helped me learn things like GUIs, API requests, async code, and building real tools.

## **Projects**

### **🌦️ Weather App (PyQt5)**
A simple weather app made with PyQt5.  
It takes a city name, calls a weather API, and shows the temperature, weather type, and an emoji icon.

### **📥 CLI Downloader (Async)**
A command-line downloader that can download many files at the same time using asyncio.  
It also lets you cancel downloads while they are running and shows progress with a progress bar.

# Downloader_manager 🚀

A simple async download manager built with **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **aiohttp**.

- 📥 Add multiple HTTP/HTTPS URLs  
- 📊 Each download gets its own progress bar  
- 📝 File name + progress shown (e.g. `video.mp4: 1.23 / 10.00 MB`)  
- 📂 Custom download folder (auto-created if it doesn’t exist)  
- 🧵 GUI stays responsive using a separate thread + `asyncio`
