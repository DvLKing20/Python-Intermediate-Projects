# Python Intermediate Projects

This repo is where I keep the projects I built while moving from beginner Python into more intermediate concepts.  
Everything here helped me understand async code, GUIs, bots, file handling, and how to structure bigger programs.

## What's inside

### 🔹 PyQt5 Projects
A simple download manager built with PyQt5.  
I used threads + async to learn how GUI apps handle background tasks without freezing.

### 🔹 Telegram Automation Bot
An async Telegram bot that can save ads, store groups, and automatically post on a timer.  
It also uses inline buttons, per-user state, and text files for storing data.

### 🔹 Pygame Game (WIP)
A small game I'm working on.  
Only the basic logic, tiles, and assets are added for now.  
I’ll update this section once the game is complete.

## Why this repo exists
I made this repo to practice real projects instead of just following tutorials.  
Each folder represents something new I learned — async, GUIs, bots, or game logic — and I keep improving these as I learn more.

## Requirements
Different projects use different libraries, but overall this repo uses:
- Python 
- PyQt5 
- PyQt6
- python-telegram-bot  
- asyncio  
- Pygame  

## Status
Still imp
